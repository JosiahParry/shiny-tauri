# Shiny Live + Tauri apps

This repo is a playground for building desktop applications from shiny-live apps. This should work for both R and Python apps. 

From a terminal run `cargo install tauri-cli`. To launch the desktop app `cargo tauri dev`. This works like a charm. 
Building the app with `cargo tauri build` works. But the app doesn't fully load and im not sure why.
